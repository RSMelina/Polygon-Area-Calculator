# Polygon-Area-Calculator
this project uses object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle, and inherit its methods and attributes.

This is the boilerplate for the Polygon Area Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/polygon-area-calculator
